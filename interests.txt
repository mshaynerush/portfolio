    <p>As stated, I'm a creative type. I have many interests besides creating websites and web applications. My interests surround music, mostly.</p>

    <p>
    When I was 14 I picked up a guitar and taught myself to play. Decades later, I use that skill to play local venues with various bands ranging from hard rock cover bands to soft
    rock original music. I love the local music scene and enjoy just being out there listening or performing.

    <p>When I'm not doing that, and when there's not school or work, I have recently taken up Luthiering. I wanted a Gibson Firebird guitar, but because they were out of my price range,
    I decided I would build one. There's a joke that goes, I know how to make a million dollars playing music. Start off as a billionaire. It's funny, but it's also appropriate to my gutitar
    making experience. I thought I would save thousands of dollars, yet I've defintely spend at least that learning how not to make guitars. So far I've made 3, and neither is great quality yet,
    but my tenacity won't let me quit. I'm just gonna keep trying until I can produce a guitar a week with great quality.
    </p>

    <p>Other intrests include movies, live shows, and the occasional road trip. I also love traveling to new places. I have been to all of the States in the west and south, but have yet to
    get up to the Northeast. One day.
