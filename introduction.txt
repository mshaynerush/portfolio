                <p>I have always had a love for technology, creativity, and anything that involves the right side of the brain. I also like to create processes that make things easier and quicker.
                Because of this I have had great success in several positions, including the position of business analyst at Puget Sound Energy where I spent most of my time devloping ad hoc applications in Excel with VBA, formulas and creative formatting to create solutions for many departments. 
                </p>
                <p>I have been the go-to guy, even among those with degrees and more experience because of my unique approach to solving problems. I like to make user experience as good as possible, with an extreme focus on accuracy so they have no issues with effieciency or quality. That would sum me up perfectly. I am the guy that will make something work depsite the prognosis, if we aren't creating useful things that enhance other people's lives and work, what are we even doing?
