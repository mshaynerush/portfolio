<h1>Introduction</h1>
<p>I have always had a love for technology, creativity, and anything that involves the right side of the brain. I also like to create processes that make things easier and quicker.
Because of this I have had great success in several positions, including the positio of business analyst at Puget Sound Energy where I spent most of my time programming in VBA within Excel
to create solutions for many departments. I have been the goto guy, even among those with degrees and more experience because of my unique approach to solving problems. I like to make
things easy for my users, with an extreme focus on accuracy so they can do their job very quickly with no mistakes. That would sum me up perfectly. I am the guy that will make something
work depsite the prognosis, if we aren't creating useful things that enhance other people's lives and work, what are we even doing?
